                    <p className=" text-lg text-slate-300">On September 8, 2021, I was honored to join a star-studded panel hosted by the National Harm Reduction Coalition for the launch of award-winning journalist Maia Szalavitzâ€™s new book on the history of harm reduction, entitled Undoing Drugs: The Untold Story of Harm Reduction and the Future of Addiction. I spoke about the foundational role of maintenance prescribing for the movement and participated in a lively discussion  about the present and future political strategy for ending the prohibitionist War on people and advancing self-determined drug user health.</p>
